# Turtle-Road-Crossing-game

Another simple road crossing game! A players can only use â†‘ (Upward) key to control the turtle. The main objective is to avoid the cars and reach the top of the screen. Everytime the player reaches the top of the screen, the level increases, which means the speed of the cars increases. That's all, enjoy!
